A little framework for creating a data webservice, greatly extensible and brilliantly usable as an ajax interface.

Create a custom Service_Core class and all public methods will be available as webservice methods. 
Any values, that these methods return will be cleanly formatted, depending on the mode.


Example web call: service.php?cmd=query&mode=json

Example console call: php -f cli.php query print 1 | more
